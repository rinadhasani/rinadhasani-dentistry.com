    <h1>Orthodontics: </h1>
    <h2>What is Orthodontics?</h2>
</div>


<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> The specialty of orthodontics is special than the other dental specialties.
    <img src="pic%202.jpg" align="right" width="500px"> Orthodontics combines more than two interrelated jobs.
   Orthodontics combines more than two interrelated jobs. Orthodontics combines medicine and engineering, as it combines biology and mechanics. 
The fundamental difference between orthodontics and the other specialties in medicine (biology) and engineering, as this fusion between medicine and engineering has a specific name: biomechanics. Biomechanics depends on many principles in physics and engineering. These principles are related to orthodontics, but there are particular functions that orthodontics dentists should follow. Therefore orthodontics is a science on its own. Orthodontics is the base for avoiding cases and problems that affect the teeth, as it is the first step for dental treatment, such as organize the teeth and accordingly, the rest of the dentists deal with the problems that can affect the teeth later. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> Orthodontics treat and work on the arrangement, shape, and alignment of the teeth, as they treat the overlapping and crooked teeth, as well as the relationship of the jaws (upper and lower jaws), which is characterized as a tooth-to-tooth relationship between the teeth in the upper and lower jaws.</p>

<h2> The target patients of the Orthodontics clinic:</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> All orthodontic clinics' target patients are children and teenagers with different ages and symptoms. Orthodontics follows the teeth growth of children from a young age, sometimes from the first appearance of teeth if there is a problem. Most of the cases that are treated begin at the age of eight years and older (teenagers)
In the last ten years, there has been a significant increase in the number of adults who put on braces for cosmetic reasons. </p>

<h2> Can you avoid the conditions that are treated by Orthodontics?</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> Unfortunately, most of the problems that are treated orthodontically can not be avoided, because they are primarily developmental conditions. Some problems are genetic, so genes can determine the size of the jaw, the relationship of the jaws, the presence or absence of some teeth, and the arrangement, shape, and alignment of the teeth. Therefore, there are some cases and conditions we are not responsible for. So all we can do is go to orthodontics to improve and organize the teeth. On the other hand, some cases may lead to the need for orthodontics that could be avoided, such as early tooth decay and dental impaction. So the majority of cases cannot be avoided, but some cases may lead to the need for orthodontics.</p>

<h2>The procedure the patient should do before getting treated in an orthodontics clinic:</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">The procedure the patient should do before getting treated in an orthodontics clinic:
Any Patient who needs to get an orthodontic treatment should have X-rays of his teeth for the dentist to get the information needed on the position of the patient's teeth. In addition, the X-ray helps make sure that everything is healthy and there are no caries or any other pathologies. The X-rays will include periapical, orthopantomography, and TLRx. The periapical is the tissue surrounding the apex of the root of the tooth that may affect or pertain to or occur in it. 
<img src="pic%203.jpg" align="right" width="350px"> Orthopantomography is a type of X-ray scan, which gives a broad view of the lower face so it can exhibit both jaws (the lower and the upper Jaws) and all the teeth in one picture including the teeth that did not surface yet as the wisdom teeth. </p>

<h2> The special equipment and instruments of orthodontics: </h2>

<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> The traditional manual tools used by the orthodontist are the mouth mirror, sickle probe, saliva ejector or suction device, Wire Cutter/Pin and Ligature Cutter, Mathieu Plier, Bird Beak or 139 Plier, Separating Pliers,  Band Pusher, Bite Stick, Band Burnisher, Posterior Band Remover, Plastic Filling Instrument, Bracket Holder or Bracket Tweezer, and Howe Utility Pliers.  </p>

<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> If the orthodontist decides to combine another specialty with orthodontics he will combine orthodontics with either dental surgery or Pediatric Dentistry. This is because these two specialties are more related to each other than any other specialty.  </p>
