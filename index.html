    <h2>What is Dentistry?</h2>
</div>

<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> Dentistry is considered a branch of medicine. <img src="pic%201.jpg" align="right"
 width="600px"> It is concerned with preserving, preventing and treating teeth and the tissues surrounding the teeth and mouth muscles. Therefore, dentistry is the medical field concerned with dental care and its problems. There are many specialties in dentistry: orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, periodontal and its surgery, dental and maxillofacial surgery, prosthodontics, oral diseases, tissues and radiology.  </p>

<h2>Who is a Dentist?</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">A dentist is the person who works to treat, prevent and preserve the teeth, gums, jaws and oral health in general. Dentists should complete four years of studying general dentistry for the examination of oral health. Then, they can specialize in a specific field after three to four years of studying.</p>

<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">- Orthodontics</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">- Pediatric dentistry</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">- Periodontal and periodontal surgery</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">- Dental and maxillofacial surgery</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">- Prosthodontics</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">- Oral diseases and tissues</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">- Radiology </p>

<h2> The Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) and Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS)</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> Both programs are the same degrees and require the same education. The programs of  Doctor of Dental Medicine (DMD) and Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) lasts six years and consists of dental public health courses, clinical science and basic science. The DMD program intends to give general practice for the graduates of the profession who are technically capable, socially sensitive in the maintenance of health and scientifically knowledgeable.</p>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> Dentists can work in a dental practice known as primary care. They are the dentists that you must visit every six months (they see at least 90% of all patients who require dental treatment).  </p>
<h2> General dentists</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">General dentists deal with the problems that a patient may be facing from day to day. They provide treatments such as implants, fillings, simple cosmetic procedures, bridges, root canals and crown so they can treat all patients within certain limits because sometimes patients have more complex issues and are referred to a specialist. All dentists should be capable of treating the aforementioned general cases because these conditions and treatments are the basics of dentistry that all dentists study in the first four years of university. Not all dentists work with these cases because they prefer to focus on their specialty. </p>

<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> Sometimes dentists combine more than one specialty based on their desire, but that requires an extra three to four years of studying. Then, they take their specialty certificate. There is no specific limit for specialization in more than one field. However, it is hard to combine more than two specializations. If a dentist wanted to combine two specialties, these specialties should be related.  </p>

<h2> Dentistry in Jordan: </h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">Jordan has the highest rate of dentists, which is many times over the assumed percentage. The minimum number of students graduating in Jordan is 600 to 800. They were supposed to close the field of dentistry in 2002 for five to ten years, because the unemployment rate for dentists in Jordan is very high, as it exceeds 40% and most of those who finish their studies in Jordan try to start their careers in other countries. This has many negative effects, especially for those who studied and graduated without a clear path to start their career. Also, a dentist needs time to gain experience in the field, so it takes at least 5 to 10 years to become a good doctor. </p>

<h2> The Common and The Rare Specialities in Jordan: </h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> The most common specialties in Jordan today are orthodontics, pediatric dentistry, prosthodontics, dental and maxillofacial surgery. The rest of the specialties have much fewer numbers; such as endodontics, but they are increasing as well. The rarest specialty is oral pathology.  </p>
<h2> Do clinics with different specialties have different equipment and instruments?</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> Dental clinics with different specialties have different equipment and instruments because every major has special tools and devices. These tools and devices develop and change every day. There are some devices or tools, in general, that any dentist should have, but, according to the dentist's specialization and the cases he treats, he uses special equipment and instruments to help him. This is the reason why dental clinics are expensive to attend, as the devices they use are expensive. </p>
