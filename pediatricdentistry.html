    <h1>Pediatric Dentistry: </h1>
    <h2>What is Pediatric Dentistry?</h2>
</div>


<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> The priority of pediatric <img src="pic%204.png" align="right" width="550px"> dentistry is to make children dont feel any pain. Pediatric dentistry always has precautions provided to the parents since birth, helping the child to live a life with no pain or discomfort from his/ her teeth. In other words, pediatric dentistry is the dental profession that specializes in taking care of the oral health of children that deals with the administration and examination of children's dental health (the child's teeth, mouth, and gums). Pediatric dentistry is also known as Pedodontist. </p>

<h2> The most common dental treatments for children teeth:</h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> The most common dental treatments for children's oral health are dental cleaning, fillings, crowns, and extractions. Dental cleaning for children is significant for children's teeth because children are more vulnerable to dental caries due to excessive sugar. Fillings are one of the most common and popular treatments or dental procedures for pediatric dentists due to the abundance of children who suffer from tooth decay. Fillings are also a simple and quick dental treatment for cavities. Therefore, the dentist will numb decayed or infected teeth so they can treat or remove the damaged parts. </p>

<h2> The target patients of the Pediatric Dentist clinic:  </h2>
   
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">The children that get treated in the Pediatric Dentistry clinic are divided according to their age because the newborn children are unaware and do not cooperate with the dentist, after the age of 5 years, the child starts to cooperate with the dentist. 
Therefore, the target patient of this clinic are children, but the children are divided into two categories that have different ways and treatments for their oral health: 
The first category is prenatal. The Pedodontis provide instructions and guides to the mother before childbirth on how to treat and care for her child's oral health. The health instructions and guidelines are in terms of thumb sucking, when she should offer soft and solid food to the child, when she should start seeing a pediatric dentist, and when she should start with an open cup.
The second category is postpartum, in which we are concerned with the correct growth of the teeth from birth to the age of eighteen years. 
 </p>
   
<h2> How to avoid these conditions and diseases:</h2>
   
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> In general, dental caries is a chronic disease for children. Children are not aware of their teeth’s health, so all the information and instructions given to parents or caregivers are necessary for the child’s dental health. There are several means to keep the child’s oral health in check. The first method is to provide instructions to the parents before birth or by visiting the child at a pediatric dentistry clinic every six months. These instructions and guidelines are from the American Academy. They wrote that the first visit takes place for children when the child’s first tooth appears and he is approximately six months old or after one or a year of his life. All the instructions were for the parents to follow up periodically every three to six months, depending on the extent of the decay in the child, or whether it is through the use of fluoride and toothpaste by wiping the teeth if the child is very young and when they grow more and they know about dental floss and how to clean the teeth.
In addition, pediatric dentistry is concerned with the type of food the child should eat (diet advice), how he/ she should eat food, and when dental reviews are of interest to all of us.  </p>


<h2> The procedure the patient should do before getting treated in pediatric dentistry clinic: </h2>
<img src="pic%205.jpg" align="right" width="500px">
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> Firstly, the child must be prepared psychologically because psychological preparation for the child plays an important role in the child accepting the treatment, and if the child gets used to visiting the dentist his stress and fear will decrease. Therefore, the child's response will be higher. In addition, if the child watches YouTube, television, or programs, movies, or cartoons related to pediatric dentistry or dentistry, in general, it will prepare the child himself for what he will undergo. </p>
   
<h2> The special equipment and instruments of  pediatric dentistry: </h2>
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;">Pediatric dentistry has many tools, but the common tools are the tools that contain fluoride to strengthen the enamel layer, especially teeth that have a weakness in the enamel layer, and there are new tools in pediatric dentistry such as Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) because it helps uncooperative young children to treat tooth decay So we put this substance on the tooth without using any device, so the decay stops until the child becomes cooperative. </p>
   
<p style="font-size:1.5vw;"> If a Pediatric dentist decided to combine another specialty with his specialty, they mostly will choose orthodontics because the orthodontics target patient is children from 8 years to 18 approximately. </p>
